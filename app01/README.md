  userName: string,
  password: string,
  email: string,
  income: number,
  saving: number,
  budget: number,
  essentials: number,
  additions: number,
  categories: array,
  Settings: {
    autoBudget: boolean
  },
  time: timestamp,
  status: string
}
```

- [ ] Monthly/yearly reports
- [ ] Export data functionality
- [ ] Category-wise spending analysis
- [ ] Budget alerts and notifications
- [ ] Multi-currency support
- [ ] Dark mode theme

## Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This is a learning/demonstration project. For production use, implement:
- Password hashing (bcrypt, etc.)
- Secure authentication (Firebase Auth)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- Error handling improvements

## Development

### File Descriptions

- **App.js**: Main application component, renders FinalProject
- **FinalProject.js**: Authentication flow and navigation setup
- **Home.js**: Main application logic with tabs, charts, and data management
- **config.js**: Firebase initialization and configuration

### Code Style
- Functional components with hooks
